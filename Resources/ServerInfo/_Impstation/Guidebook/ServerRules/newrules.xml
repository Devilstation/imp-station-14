  # Introduction
  Welcome. We are a server for fans of fans of RTVS, based on Impstation, plus a bunch of OTHER stuff thrown in for good measure.
  
  Due to our nature as a cobbled together house of cards, we aren't the most serious or strict server. However, rules are still needed to keep things nice and fun for everyone.
  
  WE ARE NOT A NRP OR LRP SERVER! Play a character. You don't have to be writing peak fiction to be acceptable, but don't use the chats like you would Discord.

  ## The Rules
  
  These rules apply at all times, including between rounds.
  
  - 1. No slurs, or offensive language of any kind.
  
  Most servers call this the golden rule.
  - 2. Do not be a nuisance. 
  
  This includes slipping people for no reason, constantly annoying Security, and leaving once you are arrested for slipping people and annoying security.
  - 3. Do not (intentionally) kill people as a non antagonist.
  
  As a non antagonist, you shouldn't antagonize. Wow, so difficult, right? If someone is really bothering you, feel free to send them into Critical, then drag them to Medical. (Or AHELP. Maybe do a little of both.)
  - 4. Do not take a high value job then leave or disengage immediately.
  
  This does not include going Cryo. So long as you leave a job slot open, things will be fine.
  - 5. Play antagonists responsibly.
  
  Die a Glorious Death, Nukeops, and any animal antagonist (such as Dragons,) are a green light to go as brazen as you want.
  Thieves are nonviolent. You do not want to hurt anyone, regardless of the situation.
  Everyone else, keep things in the objectives. You can KILL non targets, but they must be recoverable. Security Officers are valid to kill without any restrictions.
